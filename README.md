- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yash, a cybersecurity professional.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in security roles, particularly in SOC analyst and security engineering positions. I hold CompTIA Security+ (701) and AWS Solutions Architect (SAA-C03) certifications, and I am currently preparing for the CCNA and SSCP examinations!
- ðŸŒ± I enjoy keeping up with current cybersecurity trends, and on my GitHub you'll find projects in offensive security, network security, and my ongoing work in AI security. I am also currently working on a thesis in Quantum Computing security and resilience, with projected completion this December (2024)
